# Assignment 4

### Exercise 1.1.13

##### Question 1

![petrinetA](petrinetA.png)

1. Without doing any calculations can you identify any i) conservation laws and ii) sets of reactions which will leave the state unchanged?

   *Conservation Laws:*  A, B, C and D are likely to be p-invariant.

   *Set of Reactions which will leave the state unchanged:* R1, R2, R3, R4 are possibly t-invariant


2. In MATLAB construct the Petri net for this system by defining ss, rr, WsrWsr, WrsWrs and mm. (Assume the state mm contains one token in species A only.) 



3.  Use these to calculate reaction matrix AA and stoichiometry matrix SS.



4. Calculate the P and T invariants for this system and comment on their meanings. Did you identify them in part (a)?
